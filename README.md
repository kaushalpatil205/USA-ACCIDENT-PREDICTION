The "USA Accident Prediction" project employs machine learning techniques to predict car accidents and identify key contributing factors for accident occurrences. By analyzing historical accident data, various machine learning algorithms, including Support Vector Machine, Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost, and deep learning models such as Recurrent Neural Networks with Long Short-Term Memory and Gated Recurrent Units, were trained and evaluated. The project encompasses data collection, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model development, and evaluation. Experimental results reveal insights into the impact of factors such as weather conditions, time of day, and geographical location on accident occurrences, facilitating the development of proactive measures for accident prevention and mitigation. Overall, this project contributes to enhancing road safety measures and reducing the frequency and severity of car accidents in the USA.
